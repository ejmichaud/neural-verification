assistant: It looks like the y values are calculated as the running sum of the elements in the corresponding x list. So, a formula for computing y as a function of elements in x is:

\[ y_i = \sum_{j=1}^{i} x_j \]

where \( x_i \) is the ith element of the x list and \( y_i \) is the ith element of the y list.
user: Please write a Python program to compute list y from list x for the first 5 rows. Check if the output matches list y and print 'Success' or 'Failure'.

assistant: Sure! Here is a Python program to compute list y from list x for the first 5 rows. It also checks if the output matches list y and prints 'Success' or 'Failure':

```python
# Define the input lists
x_lists = [
    [42, 67, 76, 14, 26, 35, 20, 24, 50, 13, 78, 14, 10, 54, 31, 72, 15, 95, 67, 6],

    [86, 22, 77, 19, 7, 23, 43, 94, 93, 77, 70, 9, 70, 39, 86, 99, 15, 84, 78, 8],

]

y_lists = [
    [42, 109, 185, 199, 225, 260, 238, 195, 169, 168, 220, 199, 189, 219, 200, 259, 196, 277, 334, 286],

]

# Calculate and print the results
for i in range(5):
    result = []
    total = 0
    for num in x_lists[i]:
        total += num
        result.append(total)
    if result == y_lists[i]:
        print('Success')
    else:
        print('Failure')
```

When you run this program, it will calculate the corresponding y list for each x list and then check if the result matches the given y list for the first 5 rows. It will print 'Success' if the calculation matches the given y list and 'Failure' if it does not.
