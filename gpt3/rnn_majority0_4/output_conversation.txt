system: You are a helpful assistant.
user: Each row in the table below contains two lists.
Please give me a formula for how to compute y as a function of elements in x.
list x                       list y
--------------------------------------------------------
2,2,1,4,1,0,0,4,0,3            2,2,2,2,1,1,0,0,0,0
3,4,0,4,1,2,0,0,2,1            3,3,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0
4,1,3,1,4,3,1,4,2,4            4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4
2,0,0,4,3,4,4,1,2,0            2,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0
1,2,2,4,2,3,3,4,3,2            1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2
0,4,0,4,1,4,0,4,3,3            0,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,4,4
1,0,0,0,0,1,3,0,1,1            1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
2,4,4,3,3,4,3,2,3,1            2,2,4,4,3,4,3,3,3,3
4,1,1,3,2,0,4,3,0,3            4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,3
2,2,0,4,1,0,1,4,1,4            2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,1,1

assistant: It seems like the value of y depends on the frequency of each element in x, such that each unique element in x corresponds to the number of times it appeared in x. For example, in the first row, the unique elements in x are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Thus, a formula to compute y as a function of x could involve counting the occurrence of each unique element in x and returning a list of corresponding counts in the same order.

Here's an example of a formula in Python:

```python
from collections import Counter

def compute_y(x):
    counts = Counter(x)
    y = [counts[i] for i in x]
    return y
```

This formula uses the Counter class from Python's collections module to count the occurrences of each unique element in x and then constructs the corresponding list y based on the counts.
user: Please write a Python program to compute list y from list x for the first 5 rows. Check if the output matches list y and print 'Success' or 'Failure'.

assistant: Certainly! Here's a Python program to compute list y from list x for the first 5 rows and check if the output matches list y:

```python
from collections import Counter

def compute_y(x):
    counts = Counter(x)
    y = [counts[i] for i in x]
    return y

# Input data
data = [
    ([2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 3], [2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]),
    ([3, 4, 0, 4, 1, 2, 0, 0, 2, 1], [3, 3, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]),
    ([4, 1, 3, 1, 4, 3, 1, 4, 2, 4], [4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4]),
    ([2, 0, 0, 4, 3, 4, 4, 1, 2, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0]),
    ([1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 3, 3, 4, 3, 2], [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2])
]

# Compute y and check for match
for x, expected_y in data:
    computed_y = compute_y(x)
    if computed_y == expected_y:
        print('Success')
    else:
        print('Failure')
```

When you run this program, it will check if the computed list y matches the expected list y for the first 5 rows and print 'Success' or 'Failure' accordingly.
