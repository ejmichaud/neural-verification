system: You are a helpful assistant.
user: Each row in the table below contains two lists.
Please give me a formula for how to compute y as a function of elements in x.
list x                       list y
--------------------------------------------------------
0,7,7,4,7,7,2,2,6,0            1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0
0,6,7,5,4,4,2,6,3,0            1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
6,7,1,5,3,3,1,6,3,3            0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
3,6,0,6,5,6,4,7,6,6            0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
6,0,3,5,3,3,1,3,1,3            0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
7,1,0,2,5,1,6,3,0,1            0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1,1,1,2,7,3,2,2,0,7            0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
4,0,5,1,0,5,4,0,2,0            0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

assistant: To calculate `y` as a function of elements in `x`, you can use the following formula:
```plaintext
y[i] = 1 if x[i] % 2 == 0 else 0
```
This formula checks if the element at index `i` in list `x` is even, and assigns 1 to the corresponding index in list `y` if it is even, otherwise it assigns 0.
user: Please write a Python program to compute list y from list x for the first 5 rows. Check if the output matches list y and print 'Success' or 'Failure'.

assistant: Certainly! Here's a Python program to compute list `y` from list `x` for the first 5 rows and check if the output matches list `y`:

```python
# Define the list x
list_x = [
    [0, 7, 7, 4, 7, 7, 2, 2, 6, 0],
    [0, 6, 7, 5, 4, 4, 2, 6, 3, 0],
    [6, 7, 1, 5, 3, 3, 1, 6, 3, 3],
    [3, 6, 0, 6, 5, 6, 4, 7, 6, 6],
    [6, 0, 3, 5, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3]
]

# Define the expected list y
list_y_expected = [
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]

# Compute list y
list_y = []
for x in list_x:
    y = [1 if i % 2 == 0 else 0 for i in x]
    list_y.append(y)

# Check if the computed list y matches the expected list y
if list_y == list_y_expected:
    print('Success')
else:
    print('Failure')

# Print the computed list y
print(list_y)
```

When you run the above program, it will compute list `y` from list `x` for the first 5 rows and then check if the output matches the expected list `y`. Following that, it will print 'Success' or 'Failure' based on the comparison of the computed and expected lists and display the computed list `y`.
