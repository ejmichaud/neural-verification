system: You are a helpful assistant.
user: Each row in the table below contains two lists.
Please give me a formula for how to compute y as a function of elements in x.
list x                       list y
--------------------------------------------------------
0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1            0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0            0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1            0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0            0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1            0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0            0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1            0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1            0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1            0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0            0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

assistant: It looks like the function for computing y based on the elements in x is as follows:

For each element in the list x, if it is equal to 1, then the corresponding element in the list y is set to 0. Otherwise, if the element in x is equal to 0, the corresponding element in list y is also set to 0.

In mathematical terms:
y_i = 0 if x_i = 1, and y_i = 0 if x_i = 0

Where i represents the position of the element in the list.
user: Please write a Python program to compute list y from list x for the first 5 rows. Check if the output matches list y and print 'Success' or 'Failure'.

assistant: Here's a Python program to compute list y from list x for the first 5 rows and check if the output matches list y:

```python
def compute_y(x):
    y = [0 if val == 1 else 0 for val in x]
    return y

x_values = [
    [0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1],
    [0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0],
    [1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
    [0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0],
    [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1]
]

expected_y_values = [
    [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]
]

for i in range(5):
    computed_y = compute_y(x_values[i])
    if computed_y == expected_y_values[i]:
        print("Success")
    else:
        print("Failure")
```

When you run this Python program, it will compute list y from list x for the first 5 rows and check if the output matches list y, printing 'Success' or 'Failure' based on the comparison.
