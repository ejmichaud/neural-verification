assistant: To find a formula to compute y as a function of elements in x, we can use linear regression to fit a line to the data. This will help us find an equation that relates the elements in x to the elements in y.

However, since I cannot compute the linear regression with the given data here, you can use statistical software or tools like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to calculate the linear regression and find the formula. Simply input the x and y values into the software and run a linear regression analysis to obtain the equation of the line.
user: Please write a Python program to compute list y from list x for the first 5 rows. Check if the output matches list y and print 'Success' or 'Failure'.

assistant: Certainly! You can use the `numpy` library in Python to perform the computation and compare the output to the given list y. Here's a Python program for the first 5 rows:

```python
import numpy as np

# Input data
x_values = [
    [42, 67, 76, 14, 26, 35, 20, 24, 50, 13, 78, 14, 10, 54, 31, 72, 15, 95, 67, 6],
    [49, 76, 73, 11, 99, 13, 41, 69, 87, 19, 72, 80, 75, 29, 33, 64, 39, 76, 32, 10],
    [86, 22, 77, 19, 7, 23, 43, 94, 93, 77, 70, 9, 70, 39, 86, 99, 15, 84, 78, 8],
    [66, 30, 40, 60, 70, 61, 23, 20, 11, 61, 77, 89, 84, 53, 48, 9, 83, 7, 58, 91],
    [14, 91, 36, 3, 82, 90, 89, 28, 55, 33, 27, 47, 65, 89, 41, 45, 61, 39, 61, 64]
]

# Given list y
given_y_values = [
    [42, 109, 185, 199, 225, 260, 280, 262, 245, 182, 246, 234, 209, 243, 250, 272, 274, 291, 344, 340],
    [49, 125, 198, 209, 308, 321, 362, 382, 393, 339, 400, 381, 443, 431, 395, 372, 392, 396, 348, 283],
    [86, 108, 185, 204, 211, 234, 277, 285, 356, 356, 407, 409, 456, 452, 444, 450, 388, 402, 471, 409],
    [66, 96, 136, 196, 266, 327, 350, 304, 285, 306, 323, 342, 365, 395, 423, 421, 443, 373, 342, 349],
    [14, 105, 141, 144, 226, 316, 405, 419, 383, 380, 404, 369, 344, 344, 357, 347, 375, 387, 401, 400]
]

# Compute list y using linear regression
computed_y_values = [np.polyval(np.polyfit(x, y, 1), x) for x, y in zip(x_values, given_y_values)]

# Check if the computed y values match the given y values
success = all(np.array_equal(computed_y, given_y) for computed_y, given_y in zip(computed_y_values, given_y_values))
if success:
    print("Success")
else:
    print("Failure")
```

This program uses the `numpy.polyfit` function to perform linear regression and compute the values for list y based on the given values in list x. The final output will indicate whether the computation was successful. I hope this helps!
