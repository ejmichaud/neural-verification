system: You are a helpful assistant.
user: Each row in the table below contains two lists.
Please give me a formula for how to compute y as a function of elements in x.
list x                       list y
--------------------------------------------------------
0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1            1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0            1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1
1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1            0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0            1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1
0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1            1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0            1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1            1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0
1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1            0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1            1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0            0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

assistant: Upon examining the two lists, it appears that for each row, the corresponding element in list y equals 1 if the corresponding element in list x is 0, and equals 0 if the corresponding element in list x is 1. Therefore, a formula to compute y as a function of elements in x is: 

y(i) = 1 - x(i)

where x(i) and y(i) are the elements in position i of the x and y lists respectively.
user: Please write a Python program to compute list y from list x for the first 5 rows. Check if the output matches list y and print 'Success' or 'Failure'.

assistant: Here's a Python program to compute list y from list x for the first 5 rows and check if the output matches list y:

```python
list_x = [
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0],
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]
]

list_y_expected = [
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0],
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
]

list_y_computed = []

for row in list_x[:5]:
    computed_row = [1 - x for x in row]
    list_y_computed.append(computed_row)

if list_y_computed == list_y_expected:
    print("Success")
else:
    print("Failure")
```

When you run this program, it will check if the output matches list y for the first 5 rows and print 'Success' or 'Failure' based on the comparison.
