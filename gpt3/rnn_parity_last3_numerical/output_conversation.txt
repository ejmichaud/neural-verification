system: You are a helpful assistant.
user: Each row in the table below contains two lists.
Please give me a formula for how to compute y as a function of elements in x.
list x                       list y
--------------------------------------------------------
0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1            0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1
0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0            0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0
1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1            1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0            0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1            0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0
0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0            0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1            0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1            1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1            0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0            1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0

assistant: The formula for computing y as a function of elements in x is:

y_i = x_i XOR x_(iâˆ’1)
user: Please write a Python program to compute list y from list x for the first 5 rows. Check if the output matches list y and print 'Success' or 'Failure'.

assistant: Sure! Here's a Python program to compute list y from list x for the first 5 rows and check if the output matches list y:

```python
def compute_y(x):
    y = []
    for i in range(len(x)):
        if i == 0:
            y.append(x[i])
        else:
            y.append(x[i] ^ x[i-1])
    return y

# Input data
x_list = [
    [0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1],
    [0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0],
    [1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
    [0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0],
    [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1]
]
y_list = [
    [0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1],
    [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0],
    [1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1],
    [0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0],
    [0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0]
]

# Computing and checking results
for i in range(5):
    y_computed = compute_y(x_list[i])
    if y_computed == y_list[i]:
        print(f"Row {i+1}: Success")
    else:
        print(f"Row {i+1}: Failure")
```

When you run this program, it will compute list y from list x for the first 5 rows and print 'Success' or 'Failure' based on the comparison.
