system: You are a helpful assistant.
user: Each row in the table below contains two lists.
Please give me a formula for how to compute y as a function of elements in x.
list x                       list y
--------------------------------------------------------
0,2,1,1,0,2,1,2,1,2            0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1
1,1,2,0,0,1,2,1,0,1            1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1
1,2,1,2,2,1,2,0,1,1            1,1,1,1,2,1,2,2,1,1
0,0,1,1,2,1,2,2,1,0            0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1
2,0,1,0,0,2,2,1,0,2            2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
0,0,1,0,1,1,1,2,2,0            0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0
2,0,2,1,0,2,0,1,1,1            2,0,2,2,0,2,0,0,0,1
2,0,1,1,1,2,0,1,2,2            2,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
0,1,2,0,1,2,1,0,2,1            0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
1,2,0,0,1,2,1,1,2,2            1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1

assistant: To calculate y as a function of elements in x, you need to count the occurrences of each unique element in each row of list x, and that count will be the corresponding value in list y. Here's a formula to compute y as a function of elements in x:

\[
y_i = \text{{count}}(x_i)
\]

Where:
- \(y_i\) is the value of \(y\) at position \(i\)
- \(x_i\) is the value of \(x\) at position \(i\)
- \(\text{{count}}(x_i)\) is the count of occurrences of \(x_i\) in the list \(x\)
user: Please write a Python program to compute list y from list x for the first 5 rows. Check if the output matches list y and print 'Success' or 'Failure'.

assistant: Here's a Python program to compute list y from list x for the first 5 rows and check if the output matches list y:

```python
# Define the lists
x = [
    [0,2,1,1,0,2,1,2,1,2],
    [1,1,2,0,0,1,2,1,0,1],
    [1,2,1,2,2,1,2,0,1,1],
    [0,0,1,1,2,1,2,2,1,0],
    [2,0,1,0,0,2,2,1,0,2]
]

y_expected = [
    [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1],
    [1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1],
    [1,1,1,1,2,1,2,2,1,1],
    [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1],
    [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
]

# Compute list y from list x for the first 5 rows
y_computed = []
for row in x[:5]:
    y_row = [row.count(i) for i in row]
    y_computed.append(y_row)

# Check if the output matches list y and print 'Success' or 'Failure'
if y_computed == y_expected:
    print('Success')
else:
    print('Failure')
```

When you run this program, it will output 'Success' if the output matches list y or 'Failure' if it doesn't.
