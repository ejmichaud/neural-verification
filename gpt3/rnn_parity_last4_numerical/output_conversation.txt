system: You are a helpful assistant.
user: Each row in the table below contains two lists.
Please give me a formula for how to compute y as a function of elements in x.
list x                       list y
--------------------------------------------------------
0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1            0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0            0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1
1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1            1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0            0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1
0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1            0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0            0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1            0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1
1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1            1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1
0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1            0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0            1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

assistant: The pattern in the table suggests that the output y is calculated by counting the number of 1s in each corresponding subarray of x. Let's denote the number of 1s in each subarray of x as n, then the formula for y as a function of elements in x would be:

y[i] = n, where i is the index of the subarray in x and n is the number of 1s in the subarray.
user: Please write a Python program to compute list y from list x for the first 5 rows. Check if the output matches list y and print 'Success' or 'Failure'.

assistant: Here's a Python program to compute list y from list x for the first 5 rows and check if the output matches list y:

```python
def compute_y(x):
    y = [sum(subarray) for subarray in x]
    return y

x = [
    [0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1],
    [0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0],
    [1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
    [0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0],
    [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1]
]

y_expected = [
    [0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
    [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1],
    [1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1],
    [0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1]
]

y_computed = compute_y(x)

if y_computed == y_expected:
    print("Success")
else:
    print("Failure")
```

When you run this program, it should print "Success" if the computed y matches the expected y for the first 5 rows.
