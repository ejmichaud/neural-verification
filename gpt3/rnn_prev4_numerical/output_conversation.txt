system: You are a helpful assistant.
user: Each row in the table below contains two lists.
Please give me a formula for how to compute y as a function of elements in x.
list x                       list y
--------------------------------------------------------

assistant: The pattern in the table is that the first four elements of list y are all zeros, and the remaining elements are just a copy of list x.

Therefore, the formula to compute y as a function of elements in x would be:
If i is less than or equal to 4: y[i] = 0
Else: y[i] = x[i - 4]
user: Please write a Python program to compute list y from list x for the first 5 rows. Check if the output matches list y and print 'Success' or 'Failure'.

assistant: Certainly! Below is the Python program to compute list y from list x for the first 5 rows and check if the output matches list y:

```python
def compute_y(x):
    y = [0, 0, 0, 0]
    y.extend(x[:6])
    return y

list_x = [
    [42,67,76,14,26,35,20,24,50,13],
    [78,14,10,54,31,72,15,95,67,6],
    [49,76,73,11,99,13,41,69,87,19],
    [72,80,75,29,33,64,39,76,32,10],
    [86,22,77,19,7,23,43,94,93,77]
]

list_y_expected = [
    [0,0,0,0,42,67,76,14,26,35],
    [0,0,0,0,78,14,10,54,31,72],
    [0,0,0,0,49,76,73,11,99,13],
    [0,0,0,0,72,80,75,29,33,64],
    [0,0,0,0,86,22,77,19,7,23]
]

for i in range(5):
    y = compute_y(list_x[i])
    if y == list_y_expected[i]:
        print('Success')
    else:
        print('Failure')
```

When you run this program, it should output 'Success' for each row, indicating that the output matches list y for the first 5 rows.
