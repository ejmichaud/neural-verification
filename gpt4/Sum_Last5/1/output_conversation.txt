system: You are a helpful assistant.
user: Each row in the table below contains two lists.
Please give me a formula for how to compute y as a function of elements in x.

assistant: The relationship between the lists `x` and `y` may not be immediately obvious as they do not correspond directly through standard mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division applied element-wise. However, after some analysis, it becomes clear that the value of each element in `y` is the running total, or cumulative sum, of the elements in `x` up to that point.

A cumulative sum adds each number in `x` to the sum of all the previous numbers before it, and the result forms the corresponding element in `y`. Mathematically, the relationship can be described by the following formula for the ith element in `y`:

y[i] = x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[i]

In more formal notation:
y[i] = âˆ‘(x[j]) for j = 0 to i

Let's denote `f(x)` as the cumulative sum function which applies to every element in `x` and computes the corresponding `y`. So `y = f(x)` would be computed using a cumulative sum algorithm.

If you are implementing this in a programming language with array support, you can do so like this (pseudo-code):

```
function cumulativeSum(x):
    y = []
    sum = 0
    for value in x:
        sum = sum + value
        y.append(sum)
    return y
```

For the given lists, you would apply this function to each `x` list to obtain the corresponding `y` list.

If you're using spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel, you can achieve the cumulative sum by using the following formula, assuming the `x` array starts at cell A1:

For cell B1: `=A1`
For cell B2 and onward: `=B1 + A2`

You would then drag the formula from B2 down to fill the series based on your `x` list. Each cell in column B will contain the cumulative sum of `x` up to that point, forming the `y` list.
user: Please write a Python program to compute list y from list x for the first 5 rows. Check if the output matches list y and print 'Success' or 'Failure'.

assistant: Certainly! Below is a Python program that computes the `y` list from the `x` list for the first 5 rows given in your data. After computation, the program will check if the computed values match the given `y` values and print 'Success' or 'Failure'.

```python
def cumulative_sum(x):
    y = []
    total = 0
    for number in x:
        total += number
        y.append(total)
    return y

# Given data for the first 5 rows
input_data_x = [
    [42, 67, 76, 14, 26, 35, 20, 24, 50, 13, 78, 14, 10, 54, 31, 72, 15, 95, 67, 6],
    [49, 76, 73, 11, 99, 13, 41, 69, 87, 19, 72, 80, 75, 29, 33, 64, 39, 76, 32, 10],
    [86, 22, 77, 19, 7, 23, 43, 94, 93, 77, 70, 9, 70, 39, 86, 99, 15, 84, 78, 8],

]

# Expected output for the first 5 rows
expected_output_y = [
    [42, 109, 185, 199, 225, 260, 280, 304, 354, 367, 445, 459, 469, 523, 554, 626, 641, 736, 803, 809],
    [49, 125, 198, 209, 308, 321, 362, 431, 518, 537, 609, 689, 764, 793, 826, 890, 929, 1005, 1037, 1047],

    [66, 96, 136, 196, 266, 327, 350, 370, 381, 442, 519, 608, 692, 745, 793, 802, 885, 892, 950, 1041],
    [14, 105, 141, 144, 226, 316, 405, 433, 488, 521, 548, 595, 660, 749, 790, 835, 896, 935, 996, 1060]
]

# Processing rows and checking the function's output against expected results
for i, x in enumerate(input_data_x):
    computed_y = cumulative_sum(x)
    if computed_y == expected_output_y[i]:
        print(f"Row {i+1} Success")
    else:
        print(f"Row {i+1} Failure")
```

Running this program will produce output for each row, indicating whether the computation was successful or not according to a match with the expected output.
