assistant: The transformations from list \( x \) to list \( y \) seem to follow a specific pattern related to consecutive sums. More specifically, the \( n \)-th element in the list \( y \) can be calculated as the sum of the first \( n \) elements in the list \( x \). Here's the formula:

For a given list \( x = [x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_n] \), the corresponding list \( y = [y_1, y_2, y_3, \ldots, y_n] \) can be computed where:

\( y_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \)

In other words, each element \( y_n \) is the sum of all elements in list \( x \) from index 1 to \( n \).

To verify this, let's take the first row as an example:

List \( x \): 42, 67, 76, 14, 26, 35, 20, 24, 50, 13, 78, 14, 10, 54, 31, 72, 15, 95, 67, 6
List \( y \): 42, 109, 185, 199, 225, 260, 280, 304, 354, 367, 445, 459, 469, 523, 554, 626, 641, 736, 803, 809

If we apply the formula:

- \( y_1 = x_1 = 42 \)
- \( y_2 = x_1 + x_2 = 42 + 67 = 109 \)
- \( y_3 = x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 42 + 67 + 76 = 185 \)
- (... and so on for the rest of the elements)

You can execute this algorithm programmatically or by using a spreadsheet application to automate the calculation of list \( y \) based on list \( x \).
user: Please write a Python program to compute list y from list x for the first 5 rows. Check if the output matches list y and print 'Success' or 'Failure'.

```

This program defines each list of x and the corresponding list of y as given in your example. It then creates a function called `compute_y_from_x()` to compute each list y from the provided x values according to the formula. It compares the computed lists y with the provided lists y and prints the result for each row, followed by an overall success or failure message.
