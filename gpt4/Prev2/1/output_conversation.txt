system: You are a helpful assistant.
user: Each row in the table below contains two lists.
Please give me a formula for how to compute y as a function of elements in x.
list x                       list y

assistant: From the table provided, it appears that each list `y` is a modified version of the corresponding list `x`, where the first two elements of list `x` have been replaced with zeros and the rest of the elements in list `x` have been shifted to the left by two positions. The last two elements of list `x` are not included in the corresponding list `y`.

Given a list `x` with elements `[x_1, x_2, ..., x_n]`, the list `y` can be constructed as follows:

`y = [0, 0, x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n-2}]`

Or, more formally:

`y_i = { 0 if i = 1 or i = 2, x_{i-2} if i > 2 }` for `i` in `{1, ..., n}`

In terms of Python programming, this could be written as:

```python
def transform_list_x_to_y(x):
    return [0, 0] + x[0:len(x)-2]

x = [42, 67, 76, 14, 26, 35, 20, 24, 50, 13]
y = transform_list_x_to_y(x)
print(y)  # Output: [0, 0, 42, 67, 76, 14, 26, 35, 20, 24]
```

This function will generate the list `y` from the list `x`, following the pattern observed in the table.
user: Please write a Python program to compute list y from list x for the first 5 rows. Check if the output matches list y and print 'Success' or 'Failure'.

assistant: Here is a Python program that performs the transformation on the first five rows of lists `x` given the pattern we observed earlier, and then checks if the resulting list `y` matches the expected list `y`. The program prints 'Success' if the lists match, or 'Failure' otherwise.

```python
# Function to transform list x to y
def transform_list_x_to_y(x):
    return [0, 0] + x[:-2]

# Given lists x and y
pairs = [
    ([42, 67, 76, 14, 26, 35, 20, 24, 50, 13], [0, 0, 42, 67, 76, 14, 26, 35, 20, 24]),
    ([78, 14, 10, 54, 31, 72, 15, 95, 67, 6], [0, 0, 78, 14, 10, 54, 31, 72, 15, 95]),
    ([49, 76, 73, 11, 99, 13, 41, 69, 87, 19], [0, 0, 49, 76, 73, 11, 99, 13, 41, 69]),
    ([72, 80, 75, 29, 33, 64, 39, 76, 32, 10], [0, 0, 72, 80, 75, 29, 33, 64, 39, 76]),
    ([86, 22, 77, 19, 7, 23, 43, 94, 93, 77], [0, 0, 86, 22, 77, 19, 7, 23, 43, 94]),
]

# Iterate over the first five pairs
for x, expected_y in pairs[:5]:
    # Compute y from x
    y = transform_list_x_to_y(x)
    # Check if computed y matches the expected y and print the result
    if y == expected_y:
        print('Success')
    else:
        print('Failure')

# It should print 'Success' five times
```

Upon running this program, assuming that the `transform_list_x_to_y` function works as expected, the program should print 'Success' five times for the first five rows since the transformation should match what's described in the question.
