assistant: To compute `y` as a function of elements in `x`, we need to find a rule or relationship that transforms the list `x` into the list `y`. Based on the given data, it looks like each value in list `y` is the cumulative sum of the corresponding values in list `x` up to that point. That is, each `y[i]` is the sum of `x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[i]`.

More formally, if we represent our `x` list as `[x_0, x_1, x_2, ..., x_i, ..., x_n]` and our `y` list as `[y_0, y_1, y_2, ..., y_i, ..., y_n]`, then we can write a formula for `y` like this:

\[ y_i = \sum_{k=0}^{i} x_k \]

Where \( \sum \) is the summation symbol, adding up all the `x` elements from `x_0` to `x_i`.

In terms of a python function, it could be represented like this:

```python
def cumulative_sum(x):
    y = []
    total = 0
    for value in x:
        total += value
        y.append(total)
    return y
```

And if you were to input a list `x`, you'd get out the corresponding list `y`, based on the rule found above. For instance:

```python
x = [42,67,76,14,26,35,20,24,50,13]
y = cumulative_sum(x)
print(y) # This should output [42, 109, 185, 199, 225, 260, 280, 304, 354, 367]
```

This seems to hold true for all the provided pairs of `x` and `y` lists in the table. Each element of `y` appears to be the running total of the `x` elements preceding it, inclusive.
user: Please write a Python program to compute list y from list x for the first 5 rows. Check if the output matches list y and print 'Success' or 'Failure'.

assistant: Below is a Python program that computes list `y` from list `x` for the first five rows provided in your table and prints 'Success' if the output matches list `y`, otherwise, it prints 'Failure'.

```python
# Define the function to compute cumulative sum
def cumulative_sum(x):
    y = []
    total = 0
    for value in x:
        total += value
        y.append(total)
    return y

# Given data for the first five rows
data = [
    ([42,67,76,14,26,35,20,24,50,13], [42,109,185,199,225,260,280,304,354,367]),
    ([78,14,10,54,31,72,15,95,67,6], [78,92,102,156,187,259,274,369,436,442]),
    ([49,76,73,11,99,13,41,69,87,19], [49,125,198,209,308,321,362,431,518,537]),
    ([72,80,75,29,33,64,39,76,32,10], [72,152,227,256,289,353,392,468,500,510]),
    ([86,22,77,19,7,23,43,94,93,77], [86,108,185,204,211,234,277,371,464,541]),
]

# Process each row, compute y from x, and check if it matches the expected y
for i, (x, expected_y) in enumerate(data):
    # Calculate y based on x
    computed_y = cumulative_sum(x)
    
    # Check if the computed y matches the expected y and print the result
    if computed_y == expected_y:
        print(f"Row {i+1}: Success")
    else:
        print(f"Row {i+1}: Failure")
```

When this program is run with the given data, it should output "Success" for each row if the function `cumulative_sum` is working correctly and the provided data for `y` is indeed the cumulative sum of the corresponding `x`. If there is any discrepancy, it will print "Failure" for the row where the mismatch occurs.
