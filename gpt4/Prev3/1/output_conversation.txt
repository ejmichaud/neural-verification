system: You are a helpful assistant.
user: Each row in the table below contains two lists.
Please give me a formula for how to compute y as a function of elements in x.

assistant: The transformation from each list x to the corresponding list y seems to involve shifting the elements of list x to the right by three positions and filling the first three positions with zeroes.

To express this transformation as a formula or function `y = f(x)`, you could consider y as a function of index position i in list x, where x[i] denotes the element at index i of list x (with the first element at index 0), and y[i] denotes the element at index i of list y.

The formula would then be as follows:

y[i] = {
    0       if i < 3,
    x[i-3]  if i â‰¥ 3
}

Where i is the index in the list ranging from 0 to 9 (if we consider the list in the question to be zero-indexed, which is common in many programming languages).

In a programming context, you could implement this transformation in Python as:

```python
def transform_list(x):
    # Create a new list of zeros with the same length as x
    y = [0] * len(x)
    # Assign the shifted values
    for i in range(len(x)):
        if i >= 3:
            y[i] = x[i - 3]
    return y

# Example
x = [42, 67, 76, 14, 26, 35, 20, 24, 50, 13]
y = transform_list(x)
print(y)  # Output: [0, 0, 0, 42, 67, 76, 14, 26, 35, 20]
```

If you are working with spreadsheet software like Excel, you could use the following formulas to achieve the same result:

For cells containing y[0], y[1], and y[2], set the formula to `=0`.

For cells containing y[3] to y[9], set the formula to reference the cell three places to the left of the corresponding cell in list x. For example, if list x starts in cell A1, the formula in cell B4 (corresponding to y[3]) would be `=A1`, cell B5 (for y[4]) would be `=A2`, and so on, up to cell B10 (for y[9]) with the formula `=A7`.
user: Please write a Python program to compute list y from list x for the first 5 rows. Check if the output matches list y and print 'Success' or 'Failure'.

assistant: Here is a Python program that performs the transformation for the first five rows, checks the calculated list y against the provided list y, and prints 'Success' or 'Failure' accordingly.

```python
def transform_list(x):
    # Shift elements to the right by 3 places.
    y = [0] * 3 + x[:-3]
    return y

# Provided lists x
x_lists = [
    [42, 67, 76, 14, 26, 35, 20, 24, 50, 13],
    [78, 14, 10, 54, 31, 72, 15, 95, 67, 6],
    [49, 76, 73, 11, 99, 13, 41, 69, 87, 19],
    [72, 80, 75, 29, 33, 64, 39, 76, 32, 10],
    [86, 22, 77, 19, 7, 23, 43, 94, 93, 77]
]

# Provided lists y
y_lists = [
    [0, 0, 0, 42, 67, 76, 14, 26, 35, 20],
    [0, 0, 0, 78, 14, 10, 54, 31, 72, 15],
    [0, 0, 0, 49, 76, 73, 11, 99, 13, 41],
    [0, 0, 0, 72, 80, 75, 29, 33, 64, 39],
    [0, 0, 0, 86, 22, 77, 19, 7, 23, 43]
]

# Check the output and print 'Success' or 'Failure'
for i in range(5):
    computed_y = transform_list(x_lists[i])
    if computed_y == y_lists[i]:
        print(f'Row {i+1} Success')
    else:
        print(f'Row {i+1} Failure')
```

Run this program, and it should print 'Success' for each of the first five rows if the transformation is implemented correctly and matches the given list y for each respective list x.
