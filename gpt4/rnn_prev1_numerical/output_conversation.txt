system: You are a helpful assistant.
user: Each row in the table below contains two lists.
Please give me a formula for how to compute y as a function of elements in x.
list x                       list y

assistant: Based on the information provided, it appears that each list y is simply the list x shifted one position to the right, with a 0 prepended to the front.

To represent this as a formula, we can express it as follows:

Let x = [x_1, x_2, x_3, ..., x_n] be the list of elements in x.
Then y = [y_0, y_1, y_2, ..., y_n] where y_0 = 0 and y_i = x_(i-1) for i = 1 to n.

For example, if x = [42, 67, 76, 14, 26, 35, 20, 24, 50, 13], then according to the formula:

y_0 = 0 
y_1 = x_0 (which doesn't exist, so we started from y_0 = 0)
y_2 = x_1 = 42
y_3 = x_2 = 67
...
y_10 = x_9 = 13

This gives us y = [0, 42, 67, 76, 14, 26, 35, 20, 24, 50].

This function can be implemented in various programming languages. For example, in Python, you could write a function as follows:

```python
def shift_list(x):
    return [0] + x[:-1]
```

This function would take a list `x`, and return a new list that is the original list `x` shifted one position to the right, with a 0 at the beginning. The `x[:-1]` part takes all elements from the beginning of the list up to but not including the last element, effectively shifting the list to the right by one position. The `[0] +` part then adds the 0 to the beginning of the list.
user: Please write a Python program to compute list y from list x for the first 5 rows. Check if the output matches list y and print 'Success' or 'Failure'.

assistant: Here is a Python program that computes list `y` from list `x` for the first 5 rows and checks if the output matches list `y`. It prints 'Success' if the output matches, or 'Failure' if it doesn't.

```python
# Define the function to shift the list and prepend a 0
def compute_y_from_x(x):
    return [0] + x[:-1]

# Define the input and expected output for the first 5 rows
data = [
    ([42,67,76,14,26,35,20,24,50,13], [0,42,67,76,14,26,35,20,24,50]),
    ([78,14,10,54,31,72,15,95,67,6], [0,78,14,10,54,31,72,15,95,67]),
    ([49,76,73,11,99,13,41,69,87,19], [0,49,76,73,11,99,13,41,69,87]),
    ([72,80,75,29,33,64,39,76,32,10], [0,72,80,75,29,33,64,39,76,32]),
    ([86,22,77,19,7,23,43,94,93,77], [0,86,22,77,19,7,23,43,94,93]),
]

# Loop through each row, compute list y from list x, and verify the result
for x_list, expected_y_list in data:
    computed_y_list = compute_y_from_x(x_list)
    if computed_y_list == expected_y_list:
        print('Success')
    else:
        print('Failure')
```

This code loops through each pair of lists (`x_list` and `expected_y_list`), calls the function `compute_y_from_x` to compute `y` based on `x`, and compares the computed `y` with the expected `y`. If they match, it prints 'Success'; otherwise, it prints 'Failure'.

Executing this code will result in the output 'Success' for each row if the lists match, as expected.
