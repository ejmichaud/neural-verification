system: You are a helpful assistant.
user: Each row in the table below contains two lists.
Please give me a formula for how to compute y as a function of elements in x.

assistant: The operation transforming the elements of list x into list y is the absolute value. The absolute value of a number is its non-negative value without regard to its sign. This explains why all of the elements in list y are non-negative and match the non-negative values of the corresponding elements in list x.

Mathematically, the function can be expressed as:

```plaintext
y_i = |x_i|
```

Where `y_i` is the ith element of list y, `x_i` is the ith element of list x, and `|x_i|` denotes the absolute value of `x_i`.

In many programming languages, the absolute value function is typically denoted as `abs()`. If you were to write this as a formula in a spreadsheet application like Excel, for each element in list x at index i, you would use:

```plaintext
=ABS(xi)
```

Here, `xi` represents the cell containing the ith element of list x.
user: Please write a Python program to compute list y from list x for the first 5 rows. Check if the output matches list y and print 'Success' or 'Failure'.

assistant: Here is the Python program to compute list y from list x for the first five rows and check if the output matches list y:

```python
# Given lists of x
lists_x = [
    [42, -33, -24, -86, -74, 35, -80, 24, 50, 13],
    [78, -86, -90, 54, -69, 72, 15, -5, 67, 6],
    [49, -24, -27, 11, -1, -87, 41, 69, -13, -81],
    [72, -20, -25, 29, 33, 64, 39, 76, -68, -90],
    [86, -78, 77, 19, 7, 23, 43, -6, -7, -23]
]

# Given lists of y
lists_y = [
    [42, 33, 24, 86, 74, 35, 80, 24, 50, 13],
    [78, 86, 90, 54, 69, 72, 15, 5, 67, 6],
    [49, 24, 27, 11, 1, 87, 41, 69, 13, 81],
    [72, 20, 25, 29, 33, 64, 39, 76, 68, 90],
    [86, 78, 77, 19, 7, 23, 43, 6, 7, 23]
]

# Function to compute list y from list x
def compute_y_from_x(list_x):
    return [abs(x) for x in list_x]

# Check if the computed list y matches the given list y
for i in range(5):
    computed_y = compute_y_from_x(lists_x[i])
    if computed_y == lists_y[i]:
        print(f"Row {i+1} - Success")
    else:
        print(f"Row {i+1} - Failure")
```

When you run this program, it will compute the list y for each row based on the absolute value of elements in list x and then compare it with the given list y to check for a match. If there's a match, it prints 'Success'; otherwise, it prints 'Failure'.
