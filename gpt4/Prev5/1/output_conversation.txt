system: You are a helpful assistant.
user: Each row in the table below contains two lists.
Please give me a formula for how to compute y as a function of elements in x.

assistant: In the table provided, each list y is a shifted version of the corresponding list x. Specifically, list y is list x shifted right by 5 places, and the first five places in list y are filled with zeros. Mathematically, this can be represented as a function y(i) of x(i), where i is the index in the list:

```
y(i) = 0 if i < 5
y(i) = x(i - 5) if i >= 5
```

Assuming that the indexes are 0-based (i.e., the first element is at index 0), then the value of y at index i is zero for the first five elements (indexes 0 to 4) and equal to the value of x at index i-5 for all subsequent elements (indexes 5 to the end of the list).

If you need an explicit formula or a piece of code to compute y from x, here it is in Python for better clarification:

```python
def compute_y(x):
    # Create a list of 5 zeros
    y = [0] * 5
    
    # Extend the list y by the contents of x, starting from the 6th element (index 5)
    # Hence, the list y will contain zeroes in the first 5 positions
    y.extend(x[:-5])
    return y

# Example:
x = [42,67,76,14,26,35,20,24,50,13,78,14,10,54,31,72,15,95,67,6]
y = compute_y(x)
print(y)
```

This Python function `compute_y` would take the list x as input and return the list y accordingly, shifted by 5 places to the right, with the first five spaces filled with zeros. This output from the function would match the pattern observable in the table provided.
user: Please write a Python program to compute list y from list x for the first 5 rows. Check if the output matches list y and print 'Success' or 'Failure'.

assistant: Here is a Python program that computes list y from list x for the first 5 rows, then checks if the computed y matches the given y values and prints 'Success' or 'Failure':

```python
# Define the function to compute y from x
def compute_y(x):
    # Create a list of 5 zeros
    y = [0] * 5
    # Extend the list y by the contents of x, starting from the 6th element (index 5)
    y.extend(x[:-5])
    return y

# List of x and y pairs for the first 5 rows
x_values = [
    [42,67,76,14,26,35,20,24,50,13,78,14,10,54,31,72,15,95,67,6],
    [49,76,73,11,99,13,41,69,87,19,72,80,75,29,33,64,39,76,32,10],
    [86,22,77,19,7,23,43,94,93,77,70,9,70,39,86,99,15,84,78,8],
    [66,30,40,60,70,61,23,20,11,61,77,89,84,53,48,9,83,7,58,91],
    [14,91,36,3,82,90,89,28,55,33,27,47,65,89,41,45,61,39,61,64]
]

y_values = [
    [0,0,0,0,0,42,67,76,14,26,35,20,24,50,13,78,14,10,54,31],
    [0,0,0,0,0,49,76,73,11,99,13,41,69,87,19,72,80,75,29,33],
    [0,0,0,0,0,86,22,77,19,7,23,43,94,93,77,70,9,70,39,86],
    [0,0,0,0,0,66,30,40,60,70,61,23,20,11,61,77,89,84,53,48],
    [0,0,0,0,0,14,91,36,3,82,90,89,28,55,33,27,47,65,89,41]
]

# Process each row and check if the computed y matches the given y
for i in range(len(x_values)):
    computed_y = compute_y(x_values[i])
    if computed_y == y_values[i]:
        print(f'Row {i+1} Success')
    else:
        print(f'Row {i+1} Failure')
```

When you run this program, it will process the first 5 rows of x values, compute the corresponding y values, and compare them with the given y values. It will print 'Success' if they match and 'Failure' if they don't. According to the algorithm used in `compute_y`, the program should print 'Success' for each of the first 5 rows.
