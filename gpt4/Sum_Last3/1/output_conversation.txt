assistant: Each list `y` represents a cumulatively summed version of list `x`, where each element in list `y` is the sum of all previous elements in `x` up to and including the current position. 

The formula for computing each element `y_i` (where `i` is the index in the list) as a function of the elements in `x` is:

`y_i = x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_i`

This could also be expressed as:

`y_i = Σ x_j` for `j` from `1` to `i`

Where `Σ` denotes the sum. In a programming context, this could be calculated using a loop that iterates over the elements of list `x` and accumulates their sum into a list `y`.

In Python, an example code to compute `y` from `x` would look like this:

```python
x = [42, 67, 76, 14, 26, 35, 20, 24, 50, 13]  # This is an example list x
y = []

# Compute the cumulative sum
cumulative_sum = 0
for element in x:
    cumulative_sum += element
    y.append(cumulative_sum)

print(y)
```

If you're working in Excel, you could calculate the cumulative sum with the following steps:
1. Input your `x` values in a row or a column.
2. In the cell immediately next to or below your first `x` value (where you want your corresponding `y` value to start), merely reference the first `x` value (`=A1` if your `x` values start in A1).
3. In the following cell for `y` values, use a formula to add the current `x` value to the previously calculated `y` value (`=A2+B1` if `A2` is the current `x` and `B1` is the previous `y`).
4. Drag this formula across or down to fill in the rest of the `y` values based on your `x` list.
user: Please write a Python program to compute list y from list x for the first 5 rows. Check if the output matches list y and print 'Success' or 'Failure'.

assistant: Here's a Python program that will compute list `y` from list `x` for the first five rows provided in your initial message, then compare the computed lists with the given `y` to check for a match.

```python
# Define the lists x and lists y as per the data provided for the first 5 rows
lists_x = [
    [42, 67, 76, 14, 26, 35, 20, 24, 50, 13],
    [78, 14, 10, 54, 31, 72, 15, 95, 67, 6],
    [49, 76, 73, 11, 99, 13, 41, 69, 87, 19],
    [72, 80, 75, 29, 33, 64, 39, 76, 32, 10],
    [86, 22, 77, 19, 7, 23, 43, 94, 93, 77]
]

lists_y = [
    [42, 109, 185, 157, 116, 75, 81, 79, 94, 87],
    [78, 92, 102, 78, 95, 157, 118, 182, 177, 168],
    [49, 125, 198, 160, 183, 123, 153, 123, 197, 175],
    [72, 152, 227, 184, 137, 126, 136, 179, 147, 118],
    [86, 108, 185, 118, 103, 49, 73, 160, 230, 264]
]

def compute_cumulative_sum(x):
    y = []
    cumulative_sum = 0
    for element in x:
        cumulative_sum += element
        y.append(cumulative_sum)
    return y

def check_success(computed_y, given_y):
    return computed_y == given_y

# Compute and check each list
for i in range(5):
    computed_y = compute_cumulative_sum(lists_x[i])
    if check_success(computed_y, lists_y[i]):
        print(f"Success for row {i+1}")
    else:
        print(f"Failure for row {i+1}")

# Alternative you can aggregate the results and print success or failure once

# Run the checks and success/failure outcome
all_success = True
for i in range(len(lists_x)):
    computed_y = compute_cumulative_sum(lists_x[i])
    if computed_y != lists_y[i]:
        all_success = False
        break

# Print the final outcome
if all_success:
    print("Success")
else:
    print("Failure")
```

This program first defines functions to compute the cumulative sum and check if the computed list matches the given list. It then iterates through the first five rows of data, computes the cumulative sum for each row, and checks whether the result matches the expected list y. It ends by printing "Success" if all the checks passed, or "Failure" if any do not match.
