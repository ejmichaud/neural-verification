step 1: write codes in create_dataset.ipynb to create datasets. (output: data_train.txt, data_test.txt)

step 2: define model architecture in model.py (RNN in this case).

step 3: write codes in train_rnn.ipynb to train a model (defined in step 2) on the datasets (created in step 1). (output: pytroch model file storing model parameters)

step 4: write codes in check_specification.ipynb to check if your datasets meet specifications, and if your model meets specifications.
