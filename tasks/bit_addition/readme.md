step 1: run codes in create_dataset.ipynb to create datasets. (output: data_train.txt, data_test.txt)

step 2: load RNN from neural verification.

step 3: run codes in train_rnn.ipynb to train a model (defined in step 2) on the datasets (created in step 1). (output: pytroch model file storing model parameters)

step 4: run codes in check_specification.ipynb to check if your datasets meet specifications, and if your model meets specifications.
